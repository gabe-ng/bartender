## Planned Features

> Not feeling like having a cocktail? We plan to incorpate additional apis to connect databases for beer and wine that users can search through. Have a drink in mind that you would like to buy or mix? We would like to incorporate a feature that allows users to search for the mixers they need within their area and find the closest availble store.


## Installation and Deployment

> To run this app on your local system, fork or clone the repository [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/gabe-ng/cocktail-finder). On your local system, navigate to the project directory within your terminal and run `npm i` to install all required dependencies. Then open a separate window in the same directory and start up Mongo DB with `mongod`. From there, run `node server.js` in the original terminal window. The application should be available on in your browser at localhost:3000.
